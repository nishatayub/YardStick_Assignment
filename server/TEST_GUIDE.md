## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### 1. Test Free Plan Note Limit

```bash
# Login as user@acme.test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@acme.test", "password": "password"}'

# Create 3 notes (should succeed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Note 1", "content": "Content 1"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Note 2", "content": "Content 2"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Note 3", "content": "Content 3"}'

# Try to create 4th note (should fail with limit message)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Note 4", "content": "Content 4"}'
```

### 2. Test Subscription Upgrade

```bash
# Login as admin@acme.test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@acme.test", "password": "password"}'

# Upgrade to Pro plan
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tenants/acme/upgrade \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Now create unlimited notes (should succeed)
```

### 3. Test Tenant Isolation

```bash
# Login as user@acme.test and create a note
# Login as user@globex.test and list notes
# Should only see Globex notes, not Acme notes
```

### 4. Test Role-Based Access

```bash
# Try to upgrade subscription as Member (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tenants/acme/upgrade \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden

# Try to get tenant users as Member (should fail)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/tenants/acme/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MEMBER_TOKEN"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

## üìä Subscription Feature Gating

The system enforces subscription limits at the API level:

1. **Free Plan**: 3 notes maximum per tenant
2. **Pro Plan**: Unlimited notes
3. **Real-time limit checking**: Before each note creation
4. **Immediate upgrade effect**: Pro plan activation lifts limits instantly

## üîÑ Multi-Tenant Data Flow

1. User authenticates ‚Üí JWT includes tenant information
2. Every API request ‚Üí Middleware validates tenant access
3. Database queries ‚Üí Automatically filtered by tenant ID
4. No cross-tenant data leakage ‚Üí Complete isolation

This ensures that Acme users can never see Globex data and vice versa.
